OpenAPI schemas enable your agents within the Agency Swarm framework to interact with external APIs in a structured, reliable manner. By converting OpenAPI schemas into tools, agents can perform API calls with proper parameter validation and error handling, significantly enhancing their capabilities without compromising on robustness.

### How to Integrate OpenAPI Schemas

Agency Swarm offers built-in support for converting OpenAPI schemas into tools that your agents can use directly. This automatic conversion makes agents aware of API endpoints, parameters, and expected data types as defined in the OpenAPI specifications.

#### Option 1: Using the Schemas Folder

A straightforward way to integrate OpenAPI schemas is by specifying a `schemas_folder` when initializing your agent. Agency Swarm will automatically scan this folder and convert any OpenAPI schemas it finds into `BaseTool` instances.

```python
from agency_swarm import Agent

agent = Agent(
    name='MyAgent',
    schemas_folder='schemas',
    api_params={'api_schema.json': {'param1': 'value1'}},
    api_headers={'api_schema.json': {'Authorization': 'Bearer token'}}
)
```

In this example:

- `schemas_folder`: Designates the directory containing your OpenAPI schema files.
- `api_params`: Provides additional parameters for specific schemas.
- `api_headers`: Allows custom headers, such as authentication tokens, to be included in API calls.

By automatically converting OpenAPI schemas into tools, your agents perform type checking on all API parameters **before** making API calls, reducing errors and improving reliability.
</Note>

#### Option 2: Using the ToolFactory Class

Alternatively, you can use the `ToolFactory` class to convert OpenAPI schemas from local files or URLs.

<Accordion title="Converting from a Local Schema File">
```python
from agency_swarm.tools import ToolFactory

with open("schemas/api_schema.json") as f:
    tools = ToolFactory.from_openapi_schema(f.read())
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Converting from a Remote Schema URL">
```python
from agency_swarm.tools import ToolFactory
import requests

response = requests.get("https://api.example.com/openapi.json")
tools = ToolFactory.from_openapi_schema(response.json())
```
</Accordion>

### Best Practices

<Check>
- **Keep Schemas Updated**: Regularly update your OpenAPI schema files to align with the latest API definitions.
- **Secure API Access**: Use `api_headers` to securely manage authentication tokens and sensitive information.
- **Implement Error Handling**: Ensure your agents gracefully handle failed API calls and provide fallback responses.
</Check>

<Note>
When integrating external APIs, be cautious of rate limits, authentication requirements, and data privacy considerations.
