Agents are the core building blocks of the Agency Swarm framework. Each agent is a specialized entity designed to play a specific role and perform a specific set of tasks.

Agents act as wrappers for [OpenAI Assistants](https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/deep-dive#creating-assistants). The `Agent` class includes convenience methods to help you manage the state of your assistant, upload files, attach tools, and more.

## Characteristics of Agents

- **Role-Based**: Agents operate based on predefined roles that guide their interactions and decision-making processes.
- **Custom Instructions**: Each agent can be configured with unique instructions, enabling specialized behavior.
- **Tools and Functions**: Agents can be equipped with various tools to enhance their capabilities.

## Creating Agents

Creating custom agents allows you to define specialized roles tailored to specific tasks within your agency. Follow these steps to create an agent:

<Steps>

<Step title="1. Import the Agent Class">

Import the `Agent` class from the `agency_swarm` module.

```python
from agency_swarm import Agent
```

</Step>

<Step title="2. Define the Agent Class">

Create a new class that inherits from `Agent` and customize its parameters.

```python
class CEO(Agent):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__(
            name="CEO",
            description="Responsible for client communication, task planning, and management.",
            instructions="./instructions.md",  # Path to the instructions file
            tools=[MyCustomTool],
            temperature=0.3,
            max_prompt_tokens=25000,
        )
```

</Step>

<Step title="3. Provide Instructions">

Create an `instructions.md` file with detailed instructions for the agent.

```markdown
# Agent Role

As the CEO, you are responsible for overseeing all operations.

# Goals

- Communicate with clients.
- Delegate tasks to other agents.
- Ensure project deadlines are met.

# Process Workflow

1. Receive client requests.
2. Assign tasks to appropriate agents.
3. Monitor progress and report back.
```

</Step>

<Step title="4. Initialize the Agent">

Instantiate the agent by creating an instance of your agent class.

```python
ceo = CEO()
```

</Step>

</Steps>

## Advanced Parameters

<Accordion title="Parallel Tool Calls">

Control whether to run tools in parallel or sequentially by setting the `parallel_tool_calls` parameter. By default, this parameter is set to `True`.

```python
agent = Agent(name='MyAgent', parallel_tool_calls=False)
```

With `parallel_tool_calls=False`, the agent will run all tools sequentially.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="File Search Configuration">

Specify the file search configuration as described in the [OpenAI documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/assistants/createAssistant#assistants-createassistant-tools).

```python
agent = Agent(
    name='MyAgent',
    file_search={'max_num_results': 25},
    tool_resources={'file_search': {'vector_store_ids': ["your-vector-store-id"]}}
)  # max_num_results must be between 1 and 50
```

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Fine-Tuned Models">

Use any previously fine-tuned model by specifying the `model` parameter in the agent.

```python
agent = Agent(name='MyAgent', model='gpt-4o-mini-model-name')
```

</Accordion>

<Note>

**Note**: For more information on using OpenAPI schemas to create tools for your agents, see the [OpenAPI Schemas](../advanced-features/openapi-schemas) page.

</Note>

## Importing Existing Agents

For complex use cases, you can import pre-made agents.

```bash
agency-swarm import-agent --name "AgentName" --destination "/path/to/directory"
```

This copies all source files of the agent locally. You can then import the agent as shown:

```python
from AgentName import AgentName

agent = AgentName()
```

To check available agents, simply run the command without any arguments.

## Response Validator

See the [Output Validation](../advanced-features/output-validation) page for more information on how to use response validators to validate the response before sending it to the user or another agent.

## Agent Template Using the CLI

Simplify the process of creating a structured environment for each agent using the CLI command.

<Steps>

<Step title="Run the Command">

Use the `create-agent-template` command with the desired options.

```bash
agency-swarm create-agent-template --name "AgentName" --description "Agent Description" [--path "/path/to/directory"] [--use_txt]
```

</Step>

<Step title="Understand the Folder Structure">

Running the command generates the following folder structure:

```
/your-specified-path/
└── AgentName/                   # Directory for the specific agent
    ├── files/                   # Files to be uploaded to OpenAI
    ├── schemas/                 # OpenAPI schemas to be converted into tools
    ├── tools/                   # Tools to be imported by default
    ├── AgentName.py             # Main agent class file
    ├── __init__.py              # Initializes the agent folder as a Python package
    └── instructions.md or .txt  # Instruction document for the agent
```

**Explanation:**

- **files**: Store files to be uploaded to OpenAI. Acceptable formats are listed in [File Search](https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/tools/file-search#supported-files) and [Code Interpreter](https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/tools/code-interpreter#supported-files). Uploaded files receive an ID to prevent re-uploading.
- **schemas**: Store OpenAPI schemas to be automatically converted into tools. Place the schema in this folder and specify it when initializing your agent. [Read more](../advanced-features/openapi-schemas).
- **tools**: Store tools as Python files. Each file must have the same name as the tool class (e.g., `ExampleTool.py` must contain a class called `ExampleTool`). [Read more](../how-to-guides/creating-tools).

</Step>

</Steps>


### Agent Template

The `AgentName.py` file will contain the following code:

```python
from agency_swarm import Agent

class AgentName(Agent):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__(
            name="agent_name",
            description="agent_description",
            instructions="./instructions.md",
            files_folder="./files",
            schemas_folder="./schemas",
            tools_folder="./tools",
            temperature=0.3,
            max_prompt_tokens=25000,
            examples=[]
        )

    def response_validator(self, message: str) -> str:
        """Validate the response before sending it."""
        if "bad word" in message:
            raise ValueError("Please avoid using inappropriate language.")
        return message
```

To initialize the agent:

```python
from AgentName import AgentName

agent = AgentName()
```
