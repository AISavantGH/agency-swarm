Each agent in Agency Swarm also with some built-in tools inherited from [OpenAI Assistants API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/assistants/createAssistant#assistants-createassistant-tools).


## Code Interpreter

Code Interpreter allows agents to execute code within a remote Jupyter Notebook environment.

```python
from agency_swarm.tools import CodeInterpreter

agent = Agent(
    name="DataAnalyst",
    tools=[CodeInterpreter],
    # Other agent parameters
)
```

**When to use:**
- Data analysis.
- Handling structured files (CSV, Excel, etc.).
- Running standalone code snippets in a remote environment.

## File Search

File Search allows agents to search for files in a remote file system.

```python
  from agency_swarm.tools import FileSearch

  agent = Agent(
      name="Researcher",
      tools=[FileSearch],
      # Other agent parameters
  )
  ```

**When to use:**
- Update your agent's knowledge.
- Allow users to ask questions about their documents.
