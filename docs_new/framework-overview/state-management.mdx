Agency Swarm provides basic state management through its shared memory system, enabling agents and tools to share global state. This ensures consistent task execution and prevents redundant or conflicting operations.

- **Shared State**: Agents and tools can read and write to a shared state to coordinate actions.
- **State Persistence**: States can be persisted across sessions, allowing for long-term task management.
- **Customization**: Developers can implement custom state handling for more complex applications.
