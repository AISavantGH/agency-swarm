<Steps>
  <Step title="Set Your OpenAI Key">
    Begin by setting your OpenAI API key.

    ```python
    from agency_swarm import set_openai_key
    set_openai_key("YOUR_API_KEY")
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create Project Structure">
    Create the recommended directory structure for your agency:

    ```
    AgencyName/
    ├── AgentName/
    │   ├── __init__.py
    │   ├── AgentName.py
    │   ├── instructions.md
    │   └── schemas/
    │       ├── schema1.json
    │       ├── schema2.json
    │       └── ...
    │   └── tools/
    │       ├── ToolName1.py
    │       ├── ToolName2.py
    │       └── ...
    ├── AnotherAgent/
    │   └── ...
    ├── agency.py
    ├── agency_manifesto.md
    ├── requirements.txt
    └── ...
    ```

    ## Components

    - **AgencyName**: Root directory for your agency.
    - **AgentName**: Directory for each agent, containing code and instructions.
    - **Tools**: Directory within each agent for tools specific to that agent.
    - **agency.py**: Main file where agents are imported and the agency is defined.
    - **agency_manifesto.md**: Shared instructions and guidelines for all agents.
    - **requirements.txt**: File listing all dependencies.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create Tools">
    Define your custom tools by extending the `BaseTool` class and implementing the `run` method.

    ```python
    from agency_swarm.tools import BaseTool
    from pydantic import Field

    class MyCustomTool(BaseTool):
        """
        A brief description of what the custom tool does.
        The docstring should clearly explain the tool's purpose and functionality.
        It will be used by the agent to determine when to use this tool.
        """

        # Define the fields with descriptions using Pydantic Field
        example_field: str = Field(
            ..., description="Description of the example field, explaining its purpose and usage for the Agent."
        )

        # Additional Pydantic fields as required
        # ...

        def run(self):
            """
            The implementation of the run method, where the tool's main functionality is executed.
            This method should utilize the fields defined above to perform the task.
            Doc string is not required for this method and will not be used by your agent.
            """

            # Your custom tool logic goes here
            do_something(self.example_field)

            # Return the result of the tool's operation as a string
            return "Result of MyCustomTool operation"
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Define Agent Roles">
    Define your agent roles. For example, a CEO agent for managing tasks and a developer agent for executing tasks.

    ```python
    from agency_swarm import Agent

    ceo = Agent(
        name="CEO",
        description="Responsible for client communication, task planning, and management.",
        instructions="You must converse with other agents to ensure complete task execution.",  # can be a file like ./instructions.md
        tools=[]
    )

    developer = Agent(
        name="Developer",
        description="Responsible for executing tasks and providing feedback.",
        instructions="You must execute the tasks provided by the CEO and provide feedback.",  # can be a file like ./instructions.md
        tools=[MyCustomTool]
    )
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create Agency">
    Define your agency chart.

    Any agents that are listed in the same list (e.g., `[[ceo, developer]]`) can communicate with each other. The top-level list (`[ceo]`) defines agents that can communicate with the user.

    ```python
    from agency_swarm import Agency

    agency = Agency(
        [
            ceo,  # CEO will be the entry point for communication with the user
            [ceo, developer],  # CEO can initiate communication with Developer
        ],
        shared_instructions='You are a part of an AI development agency.\n\n'  # shared instructions for all agents
    )
    ```

    <Note title="Note on Communication Flows">
      In Agency Swarm, communication flows are directional, meaning they are established from left to right in the `agency_chart` definition. For instance, in the example above, the CEO can initiate a chat with the Developer (`developer`), and the Developer can respond in this chat. However, the Developer cannot initiate a chat with the CEO.
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Run Demo">
    Run the demo to see your agents in action!

    **Web Interface:**

    ```python
    agency.demo_gradio(height=900)
    ```

    **Terminal Version:**

    ```python
    agency.run_demo()
    ```

    **Backend Version:**

    ```python
    completion_output = agency.get_completion("Please create a new website for our client.", yield_messages=False)
    ```
