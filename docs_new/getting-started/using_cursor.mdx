To create agents using Cursor’s AI capabilities, follow these steps:

1. **Enable `.cursorrules` in Cursor Settings**:

   - Open Cursor IDE.
   - Navigate to **Settings** > **Cursor Settings**.
   - Enable the **Rules for AI** option to allow the use of a `.cursorrules` file.

2. **Add the `.cursorrules` File to Your Project**:

   - Obtain the `.cursorrules` file from the Agency Swarm repository.
   - Place this file in the root directory of your project.

3. **Utilize Cursor’s Tools for Agent Development**:

   - **Composer**:
     - Press `Cmd+Shift+I` (macOS) or `Ctrl+Shift+I` (Windows/Linux) to open Composer.
     - Use Composer for multi-file edits and generating entire applications based on high-level instructions.
   - **Inline Editing** (`Cmd+K`):
     - Select code and press `Cmd+K` (macOS) or `Ctrl+K` (Windows/Linux) to rewrite specific code segments.
   - **Chat**:
     - Press `Cmd+L` (macOS) or `Ctrl+L` (Windows/Linux) to open the chat interface.
     - Use Chat to interact with the AI, debug code, and get diffs of files.

By integrating the `.cursorrules` file and leveraging these tools, you can efficiently develop agents tailored to your project’s needs.
