<Note>
Agency Swarm's philosophy: Set boundaries for your agents, not specific conditions. This allows for better adaptability to real-world scenarios.
</Note>

## Summary

- **Agency Swarm** is ideal for production environments requiring full control over agent behavior, with a focus on business needs and hierarchical structures. It provides type safety to prevent hallucinations and enables easy definition of communication flows between agents.
- **AutoGen** emphasizes scalability and extensibility with its event-driven architecture and supports distributed computing but may be less efficient and harder to control agent interactions due to extra model calls for "role play".
- **CrewAI** offers flexible agent organization suitable for collaborative projects but lacks built-in type checking or error correction and may require additional development for production readiness.
