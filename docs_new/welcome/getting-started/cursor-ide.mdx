## Why Use Cursor

Cursor makes coding easier by adding AI tools directly into your Cursor IDE. These tools can help you save time by automating repetitive tasks, fixing code, and even helping your team work together more effectively.

## What are Cursor Rules

**Cursor Rules** are custom instructions that tell Cursor how to work with your code. They help the AI understand your project, make changes, and assist you in completing tasks.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Add the `.cursorrules` File to Your Project">
    The `.cursorrules` file contains the instructions that guide Cursor's AI. To add it:
    - Download the `.cursorrules` file from the Agency Swarm repository.
    - Place the file in the main folder (root directory) of your project.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Edit the `.cursorrules` File">
    You can edit the `.cursorrules` file to customize how Cursor AI works for your project. For example, you can define specific tasks or rules for the AI to follow.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Use Cursor's AI Tools">
    Cursor provides several tools to make coding easier:

    - **Composer**:
