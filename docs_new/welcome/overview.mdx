Welcome to **AI Agency**, an open-source framework for creating and orchestrating multi-agent AI systems built on top of the [OpenAI Assistants API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/overview/agents).

<Info>
  Agency Swarm simplifies the creation of collaborative AI systems by providing intuitive tools for agent coordination,
  task management, and communication. It approaches automation through the lens of real-world entities like agencies and
  specialized roles, making it more intuitive for both agents and users.
