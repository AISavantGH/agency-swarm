Welcome to **Agency Swarm**, an open-source framework for creating and orchestrating multi-agent AI systems built on top of the [OpenAI Assistants API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/overview/agents).

<Info>
Agency Swarm simplifies the creation of collaborative AI systems by providing intuitive tools for agent coordination, task management, and communication. It approaches automation through the lens of real-world entities like agencies and specialized roles, making it more intuitive for both agents and users.

## Why Agency Swarm?

Agency Swarm takes a unique approach to agent orchestration:

- **Full Control**: Complete customization of prompts without pre-defined restrictions
- **Type Safety**: Prevents hallucinations through automatic type checking and error correction
- **Intuitive Communication**: Agents determine who to communicate with based on their descriptions and agency boundaries
- **State Management**: Efficiently manages assistant states on OpenAI through a `settings.json` file

<Note>
Unlike other frameworks, Agency Swarm focuses on setting boundaries for agents rather than hardcoding communication conditions, allowing for better adaptability in real-world scenarios.
